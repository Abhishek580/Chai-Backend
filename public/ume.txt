Worked on an IoT Supply Chain-based project for a pharmaceutical client. During this project, I had the opportunity to develop APIs for various web applications, contributing to a comprehensive platform designed for image processing and storage. Specifically, I built APIs that facilitated bulk image uploads for storage purposes, served as a robust file manager, and functioned as an archival solution.

Moreover, I created numerous APIs to handle CRUD operations for different routes and implemented a generic search API specifically designed for the main search bar functionality within the web application.

Participated in the development of APIs for a web portal dedicated to managing images and their metadata uploaded from a production line. Additionally, designed APIs to facilitate the upload of videos along with their corresponding metadata.

Implemented a functionality that generates thumbnails for images, reducing load times when users are initially viewing a card displaying the image. The actual image is loaded only when the user clicks on the card, enhancing overall performance.

Moreover, contributed to a web-based product inspection solution, enhancing the efficiency of product inspections through image capture on a mobile app.

Implemented continuous integration and continuous deployment (CI/CD) using Jenkins, and refactored the code to successfully pass all the SonarLint tests conducted on the code.
I have also developed unit test cases for all the APIs using sinon, supertest, and jest frameworks. Additionally, I have created Swagger documentation for each of the APIs.

Furthermore, I have pushed all the code to Bitbucket, ensuring each commit is accompanied by clear and descriptive commit messages.
